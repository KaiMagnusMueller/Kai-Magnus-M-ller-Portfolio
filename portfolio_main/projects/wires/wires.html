    <p class="imageCaption">Wires is a prototyping application for Internet of Things projects. It allows to connect
        screen designs with hardware to create combined prototypes.

    <div class="articleWrapper">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p class="article">There is currently a wide range of tools available that make it very easy for users to create
            interactive prototypes starting with screen designs.<br><br>
            Development of projects that incorporate hardware - such as IoT projects - require specialized tools that
            are
            <b>largely incompatible to existing design and prototyping workflows</b>. Most tools are based in software
            development and focus less on UI design. If one wants to prototype IoT projects like Smart Home Apps, a lack
            of applications that connect both screens and hardware becomes apparent.</p>
        <h3>Current Approach</h3>
        <p class="article">To kick off our project we collected and analyzed a selection of existing prototyping
            software as well as hardware. Using our own experience <sup><a href="../gestures/feedback.html"
                                                                           target="_blank">1</a>, <a
                    href="../../projects/aralsea/aralsea.html" target="_blank">2</a></sup> and reports of other students
            we compiled the typical process of developing hardware projects.<br><br>
            From here on <b>we created a sample project</b> during which a Smart Home App connected to various weather
            sensors got ready for prototyping. We went through each step it took to create a working prototype only
            using tools that are currently available <b>collected difficulties and problems that arise in the
                process</b>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <img class="wideImg noshadow" src="img/tools.png">
    <div class="articleWrapper">
        <h3>Existing Tools</h3>
        <p class="article">Next we analyzed a <b>selection of prototyping tools and their features</b>. Framer Studio,
            Principle and Origami represent the three main ways to create prototypes. We collected their main features
            advantages and drawbacks and decided to drop Principle from future analysis because its timeline based
            prototypes are inherently not flexible enough.<br><br>
            <b>Framer's and Origami's features were then categorized</b> with the Kano model. Documentation, element
            grouping, shortcuts and a prototype preview proved to be essential features. Other important but not
            elemental features are separation of programming and screen design, shareable
            prototypes and code snippets.
        </p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p class="article">We based our decision whether the prototypes of our application should be patch based or
            written with classical code on the user groups we defined. While some students are more familiar with code
            based tools, <b>the number of students who can profit from more and better guidance is greater</b>.
            Implemented correctly, syntax errors are easier to spot when using patches and patches give a better visual
            overview. With this in mind we decided to focus on a patch based system going forward.<br><br> With these
            insights and our sample project, we were able to gather the necessary features for our use case and the
            order in which they became relevant.
        </p>
        <h3>Wires</h3>
        <p class="article">Often times the screen design is developed further than the hardware. To let users create
            prototypes despite no actual data coming in, <b>Wires is able to generate placeholder data where sensor
                input would
                normally occur</b>. This way the prototype can be simulated even when no hardware is actually present.
            All features are detailed in our sample use case below.
            <br><br>
            As <b>a tool for productive use</b> Wires is a native Mac App and uses standard macOS components. Main view
            is a <b>canvas in the middle where patches are arranged and connected</b>. In the <b>left sidebar all
                imported screen
                designs are listed and available</b> for use. The <b>right sidebar includes output</b> of selected
            elements and the prototype live preview.

    <p class="imageCaption interacCaption 0">Patches can be placed by searching and clicking the '+' button that
        appears. Layer patches can also be created by clicking the 'add' button next to a layer in the sidebar. The
        search gives a preview of the patches' in- and outputs and a brief description. Patches can have many different
        elements from simple text fields to checkboxes.
    </p>
    <video class="wideImg interactive" muted src="video/useCase_2.mp4">
    </video>
    <p class="imageCaption interacCaption 0">Patches can be grouped together to simplify the prototype. Groups can be
        shared as prefabs with other community members to include in their prototypes. Inputs and outputs can be set
        just as easily as the connections between patches and named for clarification.
    </p>
    <video class="wideImg interactive" muted src="video/useCase_3.mp4">
    </video>
    <p class="imageCaption interacCaption 0">All patches with Arduino connections can have their pins set in a dedicated
        panel. (Alternatively, they can be set on each patch individually) A board preview makes it easy to recognize
        the correct pins on the Arduino side. Warnings indicate unset pins.
    </p>
    <video class="wideImg interactive" muted src="video/useCase_4.mp4">
    </video>
    <p class="imageCaption interacCaption 0">Because the prototype is a live preview users can always see its output,
        whether it fails or runs as intended. Especially in large prototypes however, it is not obvious where it breaks.
        Running in debug mode, small pearls move along the connections to give a visual representation of the data flow.
        Patches can be marked as breakpoints to stop the prototype.
    </p>
    <video class="wideImg interactive" muted src="video/useCase_5.mp4">
    </video>
    <p class="imageCaption interacCaption 0">The finished prototype can be exported as a standalone app. Users can
        decide if they want to include the necessary packages to run with hardware or set new pins for another Arduino.
        This can also be done in the standalone app itself.

        <h3>Patches</h3>
        <p class="article">
            Properties can be added to patches via a plus button. <b>Values can be set manually or are variable</b> via
            their text field or with a connected input source respectively. When the placeholder pin is set on Arduino
            patches, the <b>patch itself will generate random values between the set bounds</b> and the current signal
            rate. This approach combines <b>multiple patches in one to simplify the development process</b> while
            leaving it open to custom solutions.
        </p>
    </div>
    <img src="img/patches.png" class="wideImg noshadow">
    <p class="imageCaption">Patches are grouped to indicate their responsibilities. Grey patches contain logic and other
        basic functionality, purple patches control properties and animations. Screen elements themselves are blue.
        Patches that communicate with connected hardware are turquoise, referencing the Arduino board color.
    </p>
    <div class="articleWrapper">
        <h3>Process and Technology</h3>
        <p class="article">Focus of this project was twofold. <b>First, analysis of tools, workflows and users</b> and
            <b>second the synthesis of all findings</b> into a new and improved Application.
            <br><br>
            My focus on this project was <b>tool analysis, layout, structure of patches and their behavior</b>. To
            present our final application I created the <b>interactive part of our prototype to showcase the patches</b>
            and their behavior with node.js. David Glock animated the rest of our features in After Effects. Both parts
            were then <b>combined to form a seamless interactive and animated prototype</b>.
