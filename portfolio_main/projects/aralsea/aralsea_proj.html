    <p class="imageCaption">
        Formerly one of the four largest lakes in the world, the Aral Sea has been steadily shrinking since the 1960s. With this project, we want to give a comprehensive overview of the greatest man made disaster in history.

    </p>

    <div class="articleWrapper">
        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p class="article">
            The course Interactive Communication Systems I aims to provide a look into exhibition design. After initial research into multiple topics, we were expected to choose one and present it to a user group of our choice. With this project we wanted to educate children in school and their parents in an exhibition setting about the causes and solutions to the seas condition.
        </p>
        <h3>A Man-Made Disaster</h3>
        <p class="article">The Aral Sea between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan was formerly one of the four largest lakes in the world. In the early 20th century the Soviet government decided to irrigate the desert and grow rice, melons and cotton. The remaining water flowing into the Aral Sea could not match losses through exaporation and the sea began to shrink. By 1960 between 20km2 and 60km2 of water was diverted each year. In the 1970s the Aral Seas level fell by 50-60cm each year. By 2009 only the northern part and a small strip of the southern part remained.<br><br>

            In the process of drying up the sea has left plains covered in salt and chemicals from weapons testing and industry, pesticides and fertilizer. The regions fishing industry has been devastated which caused rising unemployment. Dust storms are blowing toxic sand into settlements, causing serious public health issues.
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p class="article">With our project we wanted to raise awareness of this issue as the Aral Sea has largely been ignored in the public eye. We wanted to show the process of drying up that happened over multiple decades from the 1960s until today.<br><br>
            A central map of the Aral sea and it‘s surroundings shows the decreasing surface area. While navigating through the decades, users can access „hotspots“ around the map. And see where and when events occured. The causes and events around the drying and its influences on the population are presented in diverse and engaging media textually and visually.

        <h3>Hotspots</h3>
        <p class="article">
            We decided to use hotspots as our means of conveying information to let our users play with the available information. Separate decades give a loose chronological separation and while the hotspots have no clear order. Users are free to explore different topics at their own pace. Already read spots are greyed out to prevent confusion.

        <h3>Getting Physical</h3>
        <p class="article">
            To navigate through the decades, we built a physical model where the user takes acrylic sheets out of the sea and can figuratively drain the sea themselves. The model acts as an eyecatcher to draw visitors of an exhibition towards the exhibit. It offers a natural way of navigating time. The acrylic sheets are laser cut to represent the shorelines every decade from 1960 onwards.

        The model is made of sheets of plywood with cutouts representing the different shorelines.

        <h3>Outlook</h3>
        <p class="article">
            Despite the dire situation, the Kazakh government has made effort to restore the North Aral Sea in recent years. The Kok-Aral dam was completed in 2005 and almost completely restored the northern Aral Sea. Uzbekistan has made no efforts towards restoring the sea and continues to divert water thus the southern part remains desert.
        </p>
        <h3>Process and Technology</h3>
        <p class="article">
            As the first major group project, this project taught us a lot about coordination, discussing problems and reaching agreements as a team. After initial research we created an information architecture and started with sketches and prototypes on paper.
<br><br>
            My focus in this project was on designing and layouting hotspots and parts of the statistics  with Illustrator and creating our Framer prototype.
